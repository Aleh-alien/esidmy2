_This is part {{ include.index }} of a series of posts about revamping the user interface of OBS.
We started off with the [Package pages](/2018/10/05/revamping-ui/) in October 2018,
moved on to the [Project, User and Group pages](/2018/12/10/revamping-project-ui) in December 2018,
continued with the [Request pages](/2019/02/15/revamping-request-ui/) in February 2019
and migrated the [Configuration pages](/2019/03/03/revamping-configuration-ui/) in March 2019.
We then finished the [Maintenance pages](/2019/04/30/revamping-maintenance-ui/) in April 2019
and now, we focused on the [Search and Kiwi Editor pages](/2019/05/27/revamping-search-ui/)._

_These changes are already available for all users in the [beta program](/2018/10/04/the-beta-program)._
