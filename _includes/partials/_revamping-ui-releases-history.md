_This is part {{ include.index }} of a series of posts about revamping the user interface of OBS.
We started off with the [Package pages](/2018/10/05/revamping-ui/) in October 2018,
moved on to the [Project, User and Group pages](/2018/12/10/revamping-project-ui) in December 2018,
continued with the [Request pages](/2019/02/15/revamping-request-ui/) in February 2019
and migrated the [Configuration pages](/2019/03/03/revamping-configuration-ui/) in March 2019.
We then finished the [Maintenance pages](/2019/04/30/revamping-maintenance-ui/) in April 2019,
the [Search and Kiwi Editor pages](/2019/05/27/revamping-search-ui/) were completed in May 2019.
In June 2019 we focused on the [Cloud and Monitor pages](/2019/06/06/revamping-cloud-ui/). The
whole migration was finished in September 2019, [bye bye bento!](/2019/09/25/bye-bye-bento/)._
