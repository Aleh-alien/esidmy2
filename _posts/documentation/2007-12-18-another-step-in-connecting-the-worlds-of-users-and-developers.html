<p>
As you the Open Build Service (OBS) connects the totally
different worlds of End-Users and developers/packagers. This already works
to the degree that everybody can download software, which got packaged in
the OBS. Also the packagers already get feedback via download numbers,
tags or rating within the web interface.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://en.opensuse.org/User:Bauersman">Andreas Bauer</a> now added
the next functionality in this context. All search results in the
<a href="http://software.opensuse.org/search">End User interface</a> do offer
now a link to the packager web interface from now on. Every user, with a
standard openSUSE account can now do the ratings and taging there directly.
This will help the to improve the search results for other users later on.
</p>
<p>
Also new is the bugreport link, this means end users can create bugreports
for projects or packages hosted in OBS. Such a bugreport will get assigned
to the person, which is defined as bugowner. At this moment only a few projects
have this defined, so this is a call to all project or package owners to add
yourself. This can be done easily in the web gui, simply add yourself again
to the project, but switch to the "bugowner" role.
</p>
<p>
As usual, you can do this easily also in the meta data direct via adding the
following line to the package or project meta data.
</p>

{% highlight xml %}
<person role="bugowner" userid="adrianSuSE"/>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The userid is the usual account name. You can do this easily via</p>

{% highlight bash %}
osc meta prj -e YOU_PROJECT
{% endhighlight %}

<p>or direct via the api</p>

{% highlight http %}
https://api.opensuse.org/source/YOUR_PROJECT/_meta
{% endhighlight %}
