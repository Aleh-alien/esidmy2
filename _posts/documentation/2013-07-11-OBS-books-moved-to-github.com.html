    <p>
    The OBS books, which are accessable on these sides are hosted now at github.com. These books differ
    from the wiki pages by providing only reviewed content and are the first place where we document
    new implemented features. 
    </p>

    <p>
    We decided to move to github.com to allow easier contribution and still have some review process 
    via the pull request mechanism of github.com. You can find the repository in the offical openSUSE
    name space: <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service-documentation">https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service-documentation</a>. Check the README file on how to generate the documentation.
