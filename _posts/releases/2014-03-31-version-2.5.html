<p>
Are you ready for another set of great features for your free software packaging needs?
We are with version 2.5. of the <a href="http://openbuildservice.org" title="OBS Home Page">Open Build Service(OBS)</a>.
With this release you can plug OBS into your continuous integration/delivery chain thanks to the new
token API that let's you trigger builds from revision control systems like github.
2.5 further merges the Web UI and API into one single Ruby on Rails app, so it is easier for
you to maintain, easier for us to extend and most important way snappier to use for your packagers.
This release also begins to unify the various places where you can configure things into the
OBS API, introduces an integrated comment and notification system and saves your OBS servers
some cycles by automatically cleaning up left over branches. As you can see our team never tires
to be awesome! Read on for more, in depth, information about OBS version 2.5.

<h6>Let github.com trigger your source update</h6>
<p>
OBS 2.5 provides an API to create authentification tokens to allow the execution of
<a href="http://openbuildservice.org/help/manuals/obs-reference-guide/cha.obs.source_service.html">source services</a>.
That means you do not have to use your secret login credentials for
this, which makes it easy to hook the OBS into aps like github.com for your
continuous integration/delivery needs. Check out an example of this 2.5 feature
<a href="http://openbuildservice.org/2013/11/22/Source-Update-Via_Token/">on our blog</a>
and make sure you read the chapter in our
<a href="http://openbuildservice.org/help/manuals/obs-reference-guide/cha.obs.authorization.token.html#idm139695666033392">reference manual</a>
on this topic.

<h6>Web UI + API = â™¥</h6>
<p>
This is the first OBS release that has the web user interface (Web UI) and the application
programming interface (API) merged into a single ruby on rails app. A couple of months ago
the team decided to do this for three reasons. Most importantly it would expose the API
database, where nearly all the OBS data is stored, directly to the Web UI. Having direct
access to the API database and getting rid of the layer in between with all the overhead
(network, parsing, rendering etc.) makes the Web UI way faster, your packagers will feel this
instantly! And as OBS admin you'll have one service less to maintain, monitor and support,
isn't that something? Last but not least the new merged frontend also feels and behaves more like a standard
Ruby on Rails app, which makes all OBS developers happier and more productive! Want to know more?
Read about the merge <a href="http://openbuildservice.org/2013/10/28/webui-plus-api/">on our blog</a>!
</p>


<h6>New configuration API/interface</h6>
<p>
We try to make the OBS as flexible as possible, with sane defaults. Up until now there where several
files, spread over the different OBS components to do that. With this release we conflated this into
the new configuration API and started to get an admin panel going so you have one place to adapt
your OBS to your needs. Once we'll finish and integrate the statistics into it, this is going to be
your new browser home page! Make sure you read the <em>configuration</em> section in the 
<a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/blob/2.5/dist/README.UPDATERS">README.UPDATERS</a>
file to learn more about this feature.
</p>

<h6>Integrated Comment and Notification System</h6>
<p>
Born out of a <a href="https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/google/gsoc2013/shayonj/4978038894755840">Google Summer of Code project from last year</a>
OBS 2.5 ships with comments for projects, packages and requests. We wanted to make it possible for
our users to discuss things without ever leaving the OBS interface. The comment feature, the stalled
development of the current notification solution and the WebUI+API merge, also lead to a brand-new integrated
notification system. Up until now we have made used of a couple of external services (Hermes, RabbitMQ)
to notify about events inside the OBS. But now we are in need of a more generic system that can handle a little
bit more than sending events somewhere else. The most noteable change are that notifications are more rich in
content and the new ability for your packagers to configure their notifications inside the OBS. Additionally
the notification system has been moved from the backend to the API. The backend system is still available
but declared as deprecated.
</p>

<h6>Autodesctruct sequence for ancient branches</h6>
<p>
The amazingly neat branch->change->submit exercise inside the OBS is the essence of the Free and Open
Source developer workflow. Sometimes though, life gets in the way, and packagers have more important
stuff to do, forget or otherwise loose interest in completing this cycle, which means there are undead
branches laying around on your OBS which keep eating resources. Up until now it was a manual task to
find and kill these. With OBS 2.5 branching a package automatically sets a time at which the branch will
self-destruct (via an admin delete reuest). This is a neat feature to save resources and build power on
your OBS!
</p>

<h6>New Search Functionality</h6>
<p>
For years one of the biggest complaints about the OBS was that it was impossible to find packages. The
search ability has been part of the interface from the beginning, but with over 200.000 packages being
build today on our <a href="http://build.opensuse.org">reference server</a> it is crucial to get the
<em>right</em> package. To get to this point <a href="https://connect.opensuse.org/pg/profile/ancorgs">Ancor</a>,
from openSUSE, integrated the sphinx search engine into the OBS, so the name, title and description of
packages and projects can be combined with other attributes like the number of links/branches or activity
over time, into one big index that allows page ranking. This makes it possible for us to tweak the settings
so you find the package you're really looking for.
