An <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Build_Service_Roadmap">updated Roadmap</a>
for the Open Build Service has been published. It outlines the development targets until
the fourth quarter of 2008. Please understand the dates as target estimations, but not
as guaranteed dates. Some functionality might arrive earlier, while other features may
need some more time. 

If you would like to see features available earlier we are also very happy to help you
to start working on any of these functionalities yourself. If youre interested please drop
us a mail to our <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-buildservice/">mailing list</a>
