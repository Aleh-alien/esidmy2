title: Open Build Service adds support for Arch Linux
category: releases
---
<p>
  We are happy to announce that the <em>Open Build Service</em> (OBS) is now able to build the
  package format used by Arch Linux! With this new format you can deliver automatic, consistent
  and reproducible builds of your software to your users and customers for yet another Free and
  Open Source Software distribution. In total the OBS now supports 10 base distributions in more
  than 20 flavors and versions.
</p>

<p>
  Last years <em>Google Summer of Code</em> marked the beginning of this endeavor when 
  <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/google/gsoc2011/madgnu/13001" title="GSoC 2011 Project Page ">
  Nikolay Rysev</a> started to add all the necessary features to to support, after the RPM Package
  Manager (RPM) and the Debian package management system (deb), the third package format in the OBS.
  And with the latest deployment the OBS Team has rolled out the last missing features to the OBS
  reference server to support this.

      Arch Linux is a lightweight and flexible Linux distribution that has the core principles of focus
      on simplicity (from the developers view), elegance, code correctness, and minimalism which all stem
      from the most popular <strong>Keep it simple, Stupid</strong> (KISS) principle. It’s packages are built
      for 32it and 64bit architecture, it has a rolling release model and uses a package manager written
      specifically for Arch Linux: pacman.
