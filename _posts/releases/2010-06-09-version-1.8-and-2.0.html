    <p>
    OBS 2.0's key features are a newly designed Web UI, anonymous access and an enhanced request system.
    OBS 1.8 is an update to the 1.7 release driven by the needs of the MeeGo project.  Its major feature
    is access control enforcement. The next OBS release 2.1 will also include the access control enforcement,
    which is not yet in 2.0.
    </p>
    <p>
    The completely refreshed Web UI for OBS 2.0 allows developers to work more efficiently, as data is
    displayed where it is expected, and the Web service loads faster and provides better access to projects,
    packages and meta data.
    </p>

<h5>Anonymus access for search engine optimization (SEO)</h5>
<p>
Anonymous access in OBS 2.0 to all packages and projects offers great convenience for users
and more effectively promotes packages in the Build Service to the world at large, enabling
search engines to index the Build Service as well. It also makes it easy to collaborate with
other developers to show them patches or log files.
</p>

<h5>Review Teams</h5>

<div class="row">
  <div class="six columns">
    <p>
    With OBS 2.0, review handling by a team is supported and roles can get assigned to groups
    instead of just to a single person.

<h5>Access Control in OBS 1.8</h5>
<p>The access control enforcement feature of OBS 1.8 allows access for projects, packages and
repositories to be restricted to specified users and groups. This acknowledges privacy concerns of users.
