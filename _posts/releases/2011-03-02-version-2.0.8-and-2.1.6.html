title: Build Service team releases new versions fixing security problems
category: releases
---
<p>
The Open Build Service team has released verison 2.0.8 and 2.1.6. of OBS.
Both versions are fixing a critical security leak which can be used to modify
projects or packages without having write permission to them. We highly recommend
to update your instance of OBS as soon as possible to these new versions.
Version 1.7 is not affected by this issue.
<em>Thanks to Marcus HÃ¼we for reporting this issue.</em>
</p>

<h4>Other Fixes in OBS 2.1.6</h4>
<p>
Additionally OBS 2.1.6 is also fixing security issues in LDAP mode and a
possible crossite scripting attack vector on the login screen (full XSS protection
in all webui interfaces will be part of OBS 2.3).
<em>Thanks to Dean Pierce from Intel for discussing these issues and possible solutions with us.</em>
