the first time as official <strong>tar ball release</strong>. OBS 0.5 provides
the complete infrastructure to build single hardware architecture distributions.
System images can be created via <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:KIWI">KIWI</a>.

<h3>Overview of enhancements in OBS 0.5:</h3>
<ul> 
<li>Improved repository generation. Repositories get generated out of process of the scheduler.

<h3>About the Open Build Service</h3>
<p>
The Open Build Service is designed to host sources of packages. It can reuse sources from other
source repository systems like svn or cvs, but it is more often used to maintain all necessary files
around a tar ball release from another open source project. 
</p>
<p>
The OBS features a project modell, which easily allows team building around a set of packages and
allow the cooperation between upstream software developers and multiple packagers. It does also enable
developers to adapt existing packages and to offer different flavors of them for their use cases.
</p>
<p>
The goal of the openSUSE Build Service is to become a complete open development platform for the
Linux distributions. Therefore it does focus esp. on consistent package building via automatic
package rebuilding in case of changes of dependend package changes to guarantee always a consistent build. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Build_Service_Roadmap">Next years developing</a> will focus on
improving the collaboration features to allow submissions requests to all projects, what will allow direct
contributions to distributions. Later on we will complete the necessary features for creating installation
medias and improving the End-User interface.
