<h3>Download OBS 1.7 Beta 2</h3>

<p>
Packages for OBS 1.7 Beta 2 are available via our openSUSE:Tools:Unstable project.
You need to add this and the openSUSE:Tools project to get supporting packages.
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/openSUSE:Tools/">http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/openSUSE:Tools/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/openSUSE:Tools:Unstable/">http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/openSUSE:Tools:Unstable/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
The version of the packages are 1.6.90. We do not release packages for non-SUSE systems,
because we have currently no active packager for other platforms. If you are interested in
doing this, please speak up.
</p>

<h3>OBS-Appliance</h3>

<p>
This release is the first one which comes also with an appliance. This appliance
can be used for just demo purposes, but also to run a production OBS server.
Furthermore it can be used to deploy OBS workers in your network.
</p>

<p>
Please find details about this on this wiki page:

<p>
This appliance is of course built in openSUSE Build Service itself ;)

Hope you had a nice start in 2010 <br />
