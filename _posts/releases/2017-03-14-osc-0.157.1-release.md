### osc 0.157.1 release


We are happy to announce the osc 0.157.1 release. There are a lot of cool new features:

* add git-like blame command for files
* multibuild results are shown by default. Behavior can be switched with "osc results --no-multibuild"
* _constraints can now be prechecked with "osc checkconstraints"
* worker capabilities and information can be queried with "osc workerinfo" 
* "osc cat/less/blame" also work on checkout packages now
* added multibuild (-M) to commands
* new comment command ("osc comment list/create")
* fixed local build of kiwi images using obsrepositories://


Please use the new osc release and report bugs.<br> 
Thanks to everyone who contributed to osc!
