We are proud to announce the availability of the OBS 1.7.2 release.

The new version comes with a number of bug fixes, but also with
some new features back ported from master branch. The new functionality
allows to use existing LDAP servers for authentication. The new 
instances can be setup more easily now via the admin web interface,
esp the OBS Appliance.

Special thanks go to James Oakley for his high quality bug reports
and Luke Imhoff and David Greaves for their work on the LDAP support.

The release is as usual available via the git repository via packages
from thw openSUSE:Tools project and via appliances for USB/HDD disk images,
VMware or Live CD
