<p>
  During today's deployment we faced some issues. We had to disable rabbitmq
  support in build.opensuse.org for some hours.
</p>

<h3>What happened?</h3>

<h4>The deployment</h4>

<p>
  This morning, at 10:25am, we deployed as usual. Some minutes after the deployment was done we noticed
  some notifications from errbit, our exception tracking tool.
</p>

<p>
  We looked at the tracked exception and the related backlog and started to debug the issue. We recently applied
  a larger amount of <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop">rubocop rules</a>, a style checking tool, which means
  that we changed a decent amount of code. Because of that we suspected that this might have caused the breakage and started to 
  review the deployed commits again.
</p>

<p>
  Since we didn't find any suspicious commits, we reviewed the
  <a href="https://github.com/ruby-amqp/bunny/blob/master/ChangeLog.md">bunny changelog</a> and checked the related issues.
</p>

<h4>Diving into the problem</h4>

<p>
  Between 11:00am and 11:15am we had our regular standup meeting and we informed the rest of the team about the RabbitMQ issue.
</p>

<p>
  Right after the standup we met with the team and discussed the issue. As part of this we briefly went through what we
  found out so far and as a result we decided to disable RabbitMQ support in OBS for now.
  This way we prevented any further failures.
</p>

<p>
  After disabling RabbitMQ we concluded that the failure could have been caused by two reasons:
  <ul>
    <li>A broken SSL certificate configuration</li>
    <li>A bug in the new version of bunny</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  We split up for a short moment to investigate both scenarios in parallel. One group testing the RabbitMQ setup locally to verify
  whether the update of the bunny gem caused the exceptions.
  The other group got in touch with one of OBS admins and the maintainer of the RabbitMQ server.
</p>

<p>
  As a result we discovered that the problem was not caused by the servers, but it was either caused by a bug in the bunny gem or
  the depending amq-protocol gem.
  At 12:16pm we decided to downgrade bunny for now and created
  <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/pull/4363">a pull request</a>.
</p>

<h4>Seeing the light</h4>

<p>
  It took roughly 30 minutes until the test suite passed and we could merge the PR. Afterwards we updated our gem packages and
  had to wait for the obs-server packages to finish. This usualy takes about an hour.
  Unfortunately the SLE12 SP3 package build, that we need for deploying new packages on our OBS instance, failed. So we had to
  trigger a rebuild and wait another hour.
</p>

<p>
  While waiting for the packages to finish, a user notified us on <a href="irc://irc.opensuse.org/opensuse-buildservice">IRC</a>,
  at 1:33pm, that he was receiving duplicated email every minute.
  We could identify this error in errbit and it seemed to be related to our delayed jobs.
</p>

<p>
  Apparently we forgot to restart the delayed jobs service after disabling the RabbitMQ setup. Because of that delayed jobs was
  still trying to send notifications to the RabbitMQ server and failed while trying to.
  Once we restarted the delayed jobs service the issue was gone. That was at 1:36pm.
</p>

<p>
  At 4:10pm we finally had a built package and could deploy to solve the problem and re-enable the RabbitMQ configuration.
  By that time we noticed that there already was a new bunny release (v2.9.1), which was fixing this
  <a href="https://github.com/ruby-amqp/bunny/issues/539">issue</a>.
  Since we didn't want to delay the enablement of RabbitMQ support any further, we continued with our plan to downgrade the
  bunny version for now. Don't forget, OBS packages take an hour to build;-)
</p>

<p>
  We are going to update the patched gem version within the next days.
</p>

<h2>How will we do better in the future?</h2>

<p>
  Once we realized that there was a good chance that bunny was causing the failure, we checked the bunny changelog and issues.
  However the changelog was not up to date and thus we missed that there was already a patch and a new released version that solved
  the issue.
  So we should have checked the closed issues and recently merged commits as well.
</p>

<p>
  Obviously we did not test the bunny update with a similar setup to find out the problem earlier. We probably
  need to test RabbitMQ related changes on an instances with a production-like setup, eg. SSL configuration.
</p>

<p>
  When we disabled the RabbitMQ configuration we restarted apache to apply the change, but we forgot to restart the delayed jobs
  service. We currently think about wrapping all these tasks in one script / task to avoid that neccessary tasks are forgotten.
