During yesterday's deployment we faced some issues. We had to monkey patch some
fixes and we want to give you some insight into what happened.

There were some critical PRs deployed yesterday morning:

- ### Refactor of Event module
  We refactored the whole Event module. We renamed things, created many classes and
  moved a lot of code.

  https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/pull/4191

- ### Move ProjectLogRotate to 1 event per job
  Creating one job per event instead of running a job every some minutes which takes
  care of all of them.

  https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/pull/4197

- ### Fix huge bottleneck in notification emails
  This had been already monkey patched.

  https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/pull/4200

- ### Remove kiwi image extra version field
  A simple migration to remove a column in the kiwi images table.

  https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/pull/4209

## What happened?

Yesterday morning we ran one of our continuous deployments.

At 9:44am the deployment was done and everything seemed to work properly. Directly after the
deployment we executed the delayed job stats script to see how the delayed jobs were doing
and... we found the first problem, we accidentally removed a variable when moving
`ProjectLogRotate` to 1 event per job.
As this is a script only used by us, it was not such a problem and it was quickly solved:

https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/pull/4225

And everything seemed to work properly again. Deployment done! Or maybe not...

> Does someone know what all these errors are? ðŸ˜•

Few minutes after that, around 9:52am, we noticed some errors in Errbit, our internal exception tracker.
These errors were caused by the `UpdateNotificationEvents` job, which is run every 17 seconds to create
events. It was a really easy problem to solve (once we found out what was failing ðŸ˜œ):

So what happened?

When we refactored the Event module in <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/pull/4191">PR#4191</a>,
we created some new classes and restructured the code. As part of that we removed the package and project parent classes
that many of our OBS events inherit from.
For that we had to move some of the payload keys to their child classes. In cases of the ServiceSuccess
event we accidentally dropped one of the payload keys.

Because of the missing key, any creation of a new ServiceSuccess event was failing.

It took us about 15 minutes to debug the error, test our patch and deploy it.
Once this was done everything was back to normal and Errbit stopped reporting errors.

The pull request fixing the issue can be found here: https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/pull/4227

## How will we do better in the future?

It is clear that it was a bad idea to deploy so many changes at once. The refactor
of the Event module contained a lot of changes, which we should have deployed alone.

It would have also been a good idea to have tested all the classes of the Event module for
all of their attributes. That means that we need to improved out test suite for the classes
in the Event module.
