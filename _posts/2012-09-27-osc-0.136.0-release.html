  We are happy to announce the osc 0.136.0 release. This release is mostly a bugfix release and contains
  the following changes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>prefer TLS v1.1 or v1.2 if available</li>
  <li>declined is considered to be an open state (that is "osc rq list" also shows declined requests)</li>
  <li>added support to move files across packages via "osc mv" (fixes issue <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/osc/issues/10">#10</a>)</li>
  <li>show source package name when running "osc se --binary ..."</li>
  <li>fixed encoding detection</li>
  <li>fixed build result listing for arch packages (affects "osc build")</li>
  <li>"osc ci --noservice" also works for "external"/flat packages</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to everyone who contributed to osc!</p>
