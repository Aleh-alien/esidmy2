Next weekend the 4th [openSUSE Conference](http://conference.opensuse.org)
is going to kick-off in the beautiful city of Prague, Czech Republic.
Around 600 Free and Open Source Software enthusiasts come together for four
days to learn, hack and to have a lot of fun together. As the Open Build Service (OBS)
is developed under the hood of the openSUSE project our team will also represent.

Coolo and Henne will join the track east to help run the event but also for some OBS
specfic highlights in the programm. Naturally there is a lot going on about OBS at oSC.
Read on for some overview!


###Workshops, Talks, BoFs related to OBS


* OBS Packager Workshop

On the first day of the event Henne will begin with a general [OBS workshop](https://speakerdeck.com/u/openbuildservice/p/open-build-service-packager-workshop).
It will happen right after the opening keynote (10:00-11:30) in room Sulu.
This workshop is for packagers that want to use the OBS to produce binary packages of
their or other peoples sources. Either for personal consumption or as part as a bigger
project like a GNU/Linux distribution.

It's an interactive workshop and all you need to know to participate is how to install
software on your machine. After you've completed this workshop you will have learned how
to create, build and collaborate on packages in the OBS.

* OBS for embedded projects

On Sunday, Karsten Keil, one of our friends from our sponsor and support partner <a href="http://www.b1-systems.de/index.php?lang=en">
B1 Systems</a> will talk about how to setup building packages for a embedded platform
on a private OBS instance. This talk will take place at 11:00 in the room Kirk.

* Porting a distribution to a new architecture with OBS

An ongoing project on the OBS reference server is the openSUSE ARM port. Also on Sunday you can
listen to Alexander Graf, Dirk Müller and Andrew Wafaa who will report. Join them for their
report at 13:30 in room Spock

* Automated packaging script for OBS

Daniel Lovasko has developed a set of scripts, built on the top of the OBS command line client OSC and RPM.
Suitable for everyday packaging work-flow, or for automated creating of updates. See his introduction
to these scripts on Monday at 10:00 in room Riker

* Product maintenance with with OBS

What happens after you have cut and delieverd your project to your customers with the OBS?
How can the OBS help you to keep your customers packages up-to-date. How can you track whats
released to whom. How is the OBS supporting your developers and maintenance crew to do all that?
Find out in Markus Meissners talk about the OBS maintenance process that is used for the openSUSE
distribution. This highly interesting talk will take place on Monday at 15:00 in room Picard.

* Future of the OBS

In this Birds of a Feather session lead by our own Henne Vogelsang we want to discuss our plans for
the immediate future of the OBS. What does the OBS team think about for the short term. What do you
think should we think? Let's sync up! Join us on Tuesday 11:00 in Room L1.

###Can't get enough?
If you can't get enough of the OBS just talk to, scream at or make suggestions to [one of us](http://openbuildservice.org/team/)
after the talks, on the hallway, at the parties or wherever you can! We are looking forward to meet
all of you, listen to your concerns and hear your ideas. That is what a conference like this is all about 
for us. See you in Prague this weekend!

###About the Open Build Service
####Comprehensive
The Open Build Service (OBS) is a generic system to build and distribute binary packages from sources in
an automatic, consistent and reproducible way. Your users can always download the latest version of your
software as binary packages for their operating system.

####Collaborative
The OBS has collaboration build in and will help you to harness the power of the open source development
model. Your developers get a one-stop-shop experience for all their software packaging and releasing needs.

####Open Source
Of course the OBS is Free Software licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL). It’s available
for you as source, packages and as easily deployable appliance. You are free to use, fix, extend and re-use
the code. Check out our project [download page](http://www.openbuildservice.org/download)

Our reference server [build.opensuse.org](http://build.opensuse.org/) is available for
all open source developers to build packages for the most popular distributions including openSUSE, Debian,
Fedora, Ubuntu, Arch Linux, Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise. It is also used to
build the [openSUSE](http://www.opensuse.org) distribution.
