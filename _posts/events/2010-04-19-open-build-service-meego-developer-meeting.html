  <li>Martin Mohring from Linux Foundation</li>
  <li>Jan-Simon Möller from Linux Foundation</li>
  <li>Andreas Jaeger from Novell/SUSE</li>
  <li>Michael Schröder from Novell/SUSE</li>
  <li>Adrian Schröter from Novell/SUSE</li>
</ul>

<p>
spoke about a lot of features and wanted design changes in OBS. The MeeGo project uses OBS
to create their packages and products in similar setup and with needs as openSUSE. In short
this is having multiple code streams, which are used to create multiple products, which require
maintenance updates and QA validations. This give us plenty areas of collaboration and makes us
hoping to drive OBS in a good direction for all of us.
