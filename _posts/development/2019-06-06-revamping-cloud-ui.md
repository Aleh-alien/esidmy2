# Revamping Cloud and Monitor

We're getting closer to completing the Bootstrap migration and this time, we have revamped the Cloud and Monitor pages.

{% include partials/_revamping-ui-releases-history.md index="7" %}

# Cloud

The _Cloud_ pages were brought up to the _Bootstrap_ UI without much visual changes.
The changes are first and foremost for the code and its maintainability.
Still, you must wonder how these pages look, so we won't leave you hanging.
There you go!

# Monitor

The _Server Status_, _Workers_ and _Statistical Plots_ sections are migrated with minor changes, which are highlighted below.

#### Workers

The progress bars under each worker are from Bootstrap.

#### Statistical Plots

The _Architecture_ and _Timeframe_ options are now horizontally centered and the plots are a tad bigger.
