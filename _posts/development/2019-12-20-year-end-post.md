category: development

The year is coming to an end and we have stopped for a while to look back. Wow! :astonished: Time flies and we have lived a lot of experiences and achieved so many goals.

Bye :wave: :two::zero::one::nine: !!

Despite the changes experienced along the year, we are very proud of our achievements, especially the revamping of our user interface :heart_eyes_cat:. 
We opted for a new and well-known technology which made frontend code easier to maintain and more attractive for contributors.
Now we are delighted with such a success, we received many contributions and feedback, and most of our users appreciate the fresh and modern look and feel of Open Build Service (OBS).

We have also given the first steps on developing a new Staging Workflow, planned to substitute the existing "OBS Factory".
The Staging Workflow MVP is currently being used for some projects in production.
At the same time, some new commands have been added to allow users to deal with Staging Workflow through *osc*.

For a few weeks, we had the chance to collaborate with SCC Team. It was an excellent opportunity to learn about how another agile team works and also to create new bonds of friendship between teams :smile:.
Although it was challenging to mix our two different working procedures, we managed to adapt and work better together. We are confident that we will accomplish our shared goals soon!

2019 was also the year of improvements. It was time to refactor the code base, fix old bugs and enhance our documentation and test suite. It even brought a new release! 2.10 is already out there. :rocket:

Figures speak for themselves, during this time we have integrated around **1343** Pull Requests that turns into **2024** new commits in OBS code base.
