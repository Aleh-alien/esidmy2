---
<p>
  Here are the results the OBS frontend developer team has achieved in the last
  <strong>2 weeks</strong> (2017-05-08 to 2017-05-19).
</p>

<h3>OBS 2.8.1 Release</h3>
<p>
  We have pushed out version 2.8.1. You probably have already installed this new
  release last week right? If not check out the
  <a href="https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-buildservice/2017-05/msg00022.html">announcement</a>
  about all the cool new things we rolled into our stable release and
  <a href="/download">download</a> it.
</p>

<h3>Maintenance</h3>
<p>
  Let's start off with the maintenance tasks we did on our code base.
</p>

<h4>Migrating tests to RSpec</h4>
<p>
  We continued moving tests to our new RSpec based test suite. This sprint we've
  migrated:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    request controller tests -
    <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/pull/3052">PR#3052</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    webui helper tests -
    <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/pull/3119">PR#3119</a> and
    <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/pull/3121">PR#3121</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    package helper tests -
    <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/pull/3098">PR#3098</a> and
    <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/pull/3115">PR#3115</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Refactoring Project Build Results</h4>
<p>
  Earlier this year, in January, we have refactored how the build results of
  packages are gathered from the backend and displayed to you. This was necessary
  because the code was really horrible and difficult to maintain for us. With
  <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/pull/3101">PR#3101</a>
  we also have done this for the build results of the projects. No more horrible
  code üí™
</p>

<h4>Refactoring Request Associations</h4>
<p>
  Our <em>*Request*</em> system is using associations based on strings. So for instance a <em>*Request Action*</em>
  has an attribute <em>:target_package</em> that is a string for a package name (like "firefox")
  and <em>*:target_project*</em> that is a project name (like "openSUSE:Factory"). And then we
  have a 90 lines Class method (<em>*BsRequest.collection*</em>) for queries on those.
</p>
<p>
  All of this feels very awkward to a rails developer, it makes the code kind of
  complicated and has the result that some queries are very pretty slow. So we started
  to look into refactoring this using activerecord associations and scopes.
  First results trickle in via associations between BsRequestAction and packages/project
  <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/pull/3100">(PR#3100)</a>.
  User.declined_requests
  <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/pull/3107">(PR#3107)</a>,
  User.involved_packages and User.involved_reviews
  <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/pull/3105">(PR#3105)</a>. And by adding
  a polymorphic association to reviews
  <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/pull/3070">(PR#3070)</a>.
  Chris is going wild on those üêÖ
</p>

<h4>RubyGem Package Cleanup</h4>
<p>
  We have inspected the RubyGem packages of
  <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/OBS:Server:Unstable">OBS:Server:Unstable</a>
  for dangling dependencies and managed to remove 86 packages that we did not need anymore,
  üéâ hooraayyyy üéâ
</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<p>
  But of course we also introduced some new functionality for you üéÅ!
</p>

<h4>Download GPG keys and SSL certificates</h4>
<p>
  You can find a download link for both GPG key and SSL certificates at the project page now.
</p>

<h4>Maintenance Page</h4>
<p>
  <img src="/images/posts/sprint_16_obs-down.png" alt="A man re-painting the OBS logo" style="margin: 0 0 0 10px; float: right;">
  The OBS now has its own maintenance page (HTTP status code 503 - Service Unavailable) and a way to
  enable "maintenance mode" it in the shipped Apache web server configuration. As soon as we
  introduced it you were able to see it for a whole weekend because of the
  <a href="https://status.opensuse.org/incidents/7">problems with the openSUSE Login System</a>.
  Shite happens‚Ä¶
</p>

<h4>Image Templates</h4>
<p>
  Last week we released the new <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/image_templates">image templates page</a>
  on the reference server. It was already included in the OBS 2.8 release, but not yet enabled. This sprint we enabled it
  and wrote two blog posts presenting that feature.
  Here is the <a href="http://openbuildservice.org/2017/05/11/new-image-templates-page/">release announcement</a>.
  And there is a second blog post describing how you can <a href="http://openbuildservice.org/2017/05/15/creating-your-own-image-template/">create your own image templates</a>.
</p>

<h4>Researching Message Queues</h4>
<p>
  In <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/pull/2592">PR#2592</a>
  Stephan Kulow, ex OBS hacker, ex openSUSE release manager and currently one of
  the developers of the awesome <a href="http://open.qa/">openQA</a>, requested
  that we introduce a message queue for push notification to other tools. This
  sprint we have spent some time researching the current status of message queues
  with ruby integration. The results of this you can find in our
  <a href="https://trello.com/c/4AnoRkV3">sprint board</a>. During this
  research we have also documented our <em>Event</em> sub-system in our
  <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/wiki">developer wiki</a>.
</p>

<h3>Bugs</h3>
<p>
  And believe it or not the OBS isn't perfect yet (close, but no cigar) so we
  had to fix some problems.
</p>
<h4>Last Success for Multibuilds</h4>
<p>
  Some month ago we introduced the <a href="http://openbuildservice.org/help/manuals/obs-reference-guide/cha.obs.multibuild.html">multibuild</a>
  feature, which makes it possible to have multiple build descriptions in a package source and use so called flavors to filter them.
  Apparently we didn't integrate this into the build results API, which was reported by <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/issues/3026">nilxam</a>.
  With <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/pull/3106">pull request #3106</a> this has been fixed.
</p>
<h4>Fix request wiping</h4>
<p>
  <code>osc rq wipe *id*</code> crashed. This is fixed with
  <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/issues/3074">PR#3074</a>
</p>

<h2>Happy?</h2>
<p>
  We for sure are! What do you think? Let us know in the comments, on our
  <a href="mailto:opensuse-buildservice@opensuse.org">mailing list</a> or on
