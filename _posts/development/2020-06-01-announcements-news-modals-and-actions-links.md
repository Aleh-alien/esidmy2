# Announcements and News

Sometimes only certain groups of users need to be aware of something. For example, only for beta users, for admins, etc. Sometimes the announcement is so important that it has to be visible all over the web site and force the user to acknowledge. But sometimes it is enough to display the message inside the News box (status messages).

# Fleeing from Modals

Following our previous work with the modals, all the relevant modals from Project and Package Overview pages have their own pages.

Modals are not user friendly on small devices and more in OBS case, due to most of the modals contains large form. Having that in mind, those modals with forms have their specific pages. This change is not only intended to increase usability on small devices but to keep you focused in what you are doing.

Some of the modal dialogs changed were: project maintenance release, submit as update, create package, among others.

# New additions in Beta program

We kept working on the `actions menu`. On this deliverable the contextual links of subproject, user, repositories and attribute tabs from Project and Package are now inside this menu. The links from Package Overview are also in the `action menu`.

The edition of the package details was changed from a modal to a in-place edition, making it easier to use for small devices.
