title: Revamped User Interface for Project, User and Group Pages
category: development
---

We are moving forward in the user interface revamp! :tada:
In the past weeks, we have migrated the project, user and group pages to the new user interface,
which are already available for all users in the [beta program](/2018/10/04/the-beta-program).
This is following up on our [previous announcement](/2018/10/05/revamping-ui) from October,
where we explained why we are revamping the UI and how to provide us feedback.

Here is a comparison of the old and new user interface of the project overview page:

# The New Pages

All the new pages now have a new design and work on your phone! :iphone:
Some of them were completely re-designed in order to optimize the space and improve usability. :bowtie:
You may notice the difference between the old and the new user interface in those cases.
Please pay special attention to them: the repositories and pulse pages.
Your feedback is going to be very helpful, especially for those pages.

## The Repositories Page

This page has been the one that has more significantly changed.
We have moved the links to add repositories to the top (where they are easy to find) and added the _Add from a Project_ option,
which used to be in the _Add Repository from Distribution_ page and called _Expert mode_.
In addition, repositories are now showed in cards, where the information is condensed and nicely displayed.
Last but not least, the edit options are in independent modals that appear in the center of the screen instead of mixed with the displayed information.

This is how the new beautiful _Repositories for project_ page looks like:

<img src="/images/posts/revamping-project-ui/repositories_modal.png" alt="New modal window for repositories page in the new UI" />

The _Add Repository from Distribution_ page looks very similar to the old one, but without the _Expert mode_ link:

## The Pulse Page

The pulse page has better visual cues and it is organized in sections. :cupid:
It also allows you to decide the period of time to visualize.
Check how different the page looks:

## The Monitor Page

The old version of this page looks broken because the build status table overflows and breaks the layout.
The new page does not only fix this bug, but it provides more functionality as well.
The columns are sortable, with a client-side search, pagination and a legend. :gem:
This is how it looks:

## And Much More

The rest of the pages keep the same structure, but with a new look and feel.
The following images summarize the major changes, but go ahead and try it yourself! :mag:

# How to Give Us Feedback

As always, we need your feedback to make this even better.
Don't forget to join the [beta program](/2018/10/04/the-beta-program), try the new user interface and tell us what you think about it. :pray:
Please read the *How Give Us Feedback* section in our [previous announcement](/2018/10/05/revamping-ui/). We are looking for:

- Bugs, so anything breaking workflows.
- Design feedback, so anything related to the user experience and interface.
- How it works on your device / browser.


# What Is Coming Next?

We will be working next on the request pages. Stay tuned, we will inform you as soon as it is available in the beta program.

We are looking forward to hearing from you on [GitHub](https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/issues/new/choose) and in the `#opensuse-buildservice` IRC channel on *Freenode*! :kissing_heart:
