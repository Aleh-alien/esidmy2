title: Open Build Service Expands Support to Red Hat and CentOS
category: project
---

<p>
The Open Build Service, an innovative framework that provides an infrastructure
for software developers to easily create and compile packages for multiple Linux
distributions, has extended its support to build packages for CentOS and Red Hat
Enterprise Linux. The Open Build Service already supports several Linux distributions
including openSUSE, Debian, Fedora, Mandriva, SUSE Linux Enterprise and Ubuntu.

<blockquote>
As its name suggests, the openSUSE project is committed to choice and opposed to the exclusion of innovation
simply because it may have originated in another project. By adding support to build packages for CentOS and Red Hat
Enterprise Linux, the Open Build Service makes it even easier to build packages across multiple Linux distributions,
thus further enabling innovative ideas to spread quickly throughout the free and open source software community.
As we seek to streamline and improve collaboration between all Linux developers, the Open Build Service continues
to innovate and improve the way packages are built by providing a common framework that works with any Linux distribution.

Huge thanks and congratulations go to Adrian Schr√∂ter and the Open Build Service team for implementing this great new
capability.
