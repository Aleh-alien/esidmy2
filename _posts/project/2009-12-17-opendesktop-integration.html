<p>
Today Frank Karlitschek, maintainer of the openDesktop.org network,
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20091225195943/http://blog.karlitschek.de/2009/12/opensuse-buildservice-integration.html">
announced that the first step of integration with openDesktop.org is complete</a>.
Effective immediately, developers can add their Build Service ID to projects
on openDesktop.org, and all packages available from the Open Build Service
will automatically show up on the openDesktop.org pages.
</p>

<p>
The openDesktop.org sites include openDesktop.org, KDE-Apps.org, GNOME-Apps.org,
KDE-Look.org, and GNOME-Look.org. The openDesktop.org network reaches more than
150,000 registered contributors, and has more than 90 million page views per month
from 2 million unique visitors. This is an excellent opportunity for the Open Build Service
to reach a much wider audience and deliver on the goal of providing packages for
all major Linux distributions.
</p>

<p>The integration solves a problem for openDesktop.org users in that applications
on openDesktop.org are often available only as source or binaries for a limited number
of Linux distributions. We want to worktogether with openDesktop.org and other
organizations to make the Open Build Service a tool to build and provide packages
for all major Linux distributions.
</p>

<p>
The work between openDesktop.org and the openSUSE Project has been in progress for
several months. Plans are also in the works to allow upload directly from Qt-Create
or KDevelop to the Open Build Service and KDE-Apps.org.
