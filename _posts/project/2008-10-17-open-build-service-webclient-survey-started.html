Today we started an Open Build Service Webclient
<a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=d4ovT179sAK_2f1gmuApBAjg_3d_3d" target="_blank">online survey</a>.
We want to get more informations about the Open Build Service Webclient users,
the used hardware and software and (potential) use cases.
</p>

<p>
If you use, used or want to use the OBS, please participate on the survey and help us to make a solid new version of the
web client .

The survey is available on surveymonkey.com via this
