    As part of their openSUSE release series, Novell Open Audio <a href="http://www.novell.com/feeds/openaudio/?p=186">
    has talked to</a> Michael Schr√∂der and Andreas Bauer about the Open Build Service</a>, our powerful cross-distribution
    package build system. They discuss a bunch of updates which happened over the year since last coverage,
    what is being worked on currently and a little bit on how you can have your projects hosted on the service.
