Our own Klaas Freitag wrote an article about the Open Build Service
that got published in the german edition of Linux Magazin. It covers general introduction
into the Open Build Service, tutorials how to build a simple package, touches upon OSC and
web client and gives an overview over the underlying technology.

Everyone able to read german can grab a pdf copy <a href="/files/Software_fuer_Millionen.pdf">here</a>.
