h1. osc 0.136.0 release

p. We are happy to announce the osc 0.136.0 release. This release is mostly a bugfix release and contains the following changes:

* prefer TLS v1.1 or v1.2 if available
* declined is considered to be an open state (that is "osc rq list" also shows declined requests)
* added support to move files across packages via "osc mv" (fixes issue "#10":https://github.com/openSUSE/osc/issues/10)
* show source package name when running "osc se --binary ..."
* fixed encoding detection
* fixed build result listing for arch packages (affects "osc build")
* "osc ci --noservice" also works for "external"/flat packages

p. Thanks to everyone who contributed to osc!
