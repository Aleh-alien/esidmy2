  <h3>Community Support</h3>
  <p>
  OBS is developed as open source project and uses therefore the usual Free and Open Source Software community resources
  for contacting the developers.
  </p>
  <p>
  Support for administrations and installation problems are handled via the
  <a href="mailto:opensuse-buildservice+subscribe@opensuse.org" rel="nofollow">opensuse-buildservice mailing list</a>
  (<a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/archive/opensuse-buildservice/" rel="nofollow">archive</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
  You can <a href="https://bugzilla.novell.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=openSUSE+Build+Service" rel="nofollow">report bugs
  for the build service through Bugzilla</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  The IRC channel <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/openSUSE-buildservice" rel="nofollow">#openSUSE-buildservice</a> on
  freenode is also used for community support.
