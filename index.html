        <h3 class="ui header">What can the Open Build Service do?</h3>
        <p>
          The Open Build Service (OBS) is a generic system to build and distribute binary packages from sources in an automatic, consistent and reproducible way.
          You can release packages as well as updates, add-ons, appliances and entire distributions for a wide range of operating systems and hardware architectures.

        <h3 class="ui header">For Users</h3>
        <p>
          Your users can always download the latest version of your software as binary packages for their operating system.
          They use the package management tools they are familiar with and will get your software just like they get software from their OS supplier.
          They don't have to know about tarballs, make install, package formats or other stuff from the 90's.
          Once they are connected to your repository, you can serve them with maintesquare-imagece or security updates and even add-ons for your software.
          The OBS makes it a breeze for you, to make it super easy for them to enjoy your software!

          The OBS API allows different clients and external services to interface and to use its resources.
          Of course OBS is free software, licensed under GPL, and can be installed on your hardware, in your data center so you keep all your data under your control.
