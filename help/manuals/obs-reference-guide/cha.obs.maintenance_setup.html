        However, this should not be limited to openSUSE distribution projects but be usable anywhere
        (the entire workflow or just parts of it).
        </p><p>The goal of the OBS maintenance process is to publish updates for a frozen project, in
        this example an entire distribution. These updates need to be approved by a maintenance 
        team and the published result must contain documentation about the changes and be applicable
	in the easiest way by the users. The result is a package repository with additional informations
	about the solved problems and defined groups of packages to achieve that. Also binary delta data
        may get generated to reduce the needed download size for the clients.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm140107794347760"></a>11.1. Simple Project Setup<span class="permalink"><a title="Copy Permalink" href="#idm140107794347760">¶</a></span></h2></div></div></div><div class="figure"><a id="idm140107797105984"></a><p class="title"><strong>Figure 11.1. Simple Project Setup</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="800"><tr><td><img src="images/maintenance_project_setup.png" width="800" alt="Simple Project Setup" /></td></tr></table></div></div></div><br class="figure-break" /><p>This figure is giving a basic overview about the project setup and general workflow for a single
          package and single maintained distribution. It shows the "openSUSE:11.4" project, which is considered to be frozen and not changing
          at all anymore. The "openSUSE:11.4:Update" projects hosts all officially released updates. It does not build
          any binary, just gets it sources and binaries from the maintenance incident project via the release process. The
          incident project is named "openSUSE:Maintenance:IDxxx" in this example, which is under control of the maintenance team.
          Official updates get built and reviewed here. QA teams are also
          testing the binaries from here. However, a user can prepare it in the same way in his project and start the 
          maintenance process via doing a "maintenance" request.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

This is typically done by
            creating an own maintenance project. Usually multiple released products are affected, so the server can find
            out which one are maintained by a given source package name, in this example for glibc including checkout via</p><pre class="screen"><span class="command"><strong>osc mbranch glibc</strong></span>
<span class="command"><strong>osc mbranch --checkout glibc</strong></span></pre><p>This is equivalent to the api call <span class="command"><strong>/source?cmd=branch&amp;package=glibc</strong></span>.</p><p>It is also possible to branch only one defined version, if it is known that only one version is affected. In this
            example the openSUSE:12.1 version:</p><pre class="screen"><span class="command"><strong>osc branch --maintenance openSUSE:12.1 glibc</strong></span>
<span class="command"><strong>osc branch -M -c openSUSE:12.1 glibc</strong></span></pre><p>NOTE: both branch commands do support the --noaccess parameter, which will create a hidden project. This may be used
            when a not yet public known security shall get fixed.</p><p>Afterwards the user needs to do the needed modifications. Packages will be built and can be tested. Afterwards he
            may add informations about the purpose of this maintenance update via</p><pre class="screen"><span class="command"><strong>osc patchinfo</strong></span></pre><p>If the source changes contain references to issue trackers (like bugzilla, CVE or FATE) these will be added to the _patchinfo file.</p><p>The server will create a full maintenance channel now, in case the user wants to test this as well. After the user 
            has tested, he has to create a maintenancerequest to ask the maintenance team to accept this as official update incident:</p><pre class="screen"><span class="command"><strong>osc maintenancerequest</strong></span></pre><p>On accepting this request all sources of the entire project will get copied to the incident project and be rebuild.
            The origin project gets usually removed (based on the request cleanup options).</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="idm140107797674208"></a>11.2.2. Way B: Submitting a package without branching<span class="permalink"><a title="Copy Permalink" href="#idm140107797674208">¶</a></span></h3></div></div></div><p>You may submit a package source from a project which is not prepared as maintenance project. That works via the maintenancerequest
            mechanism by specifing one or more packages from one project. As a consequence it means also that the first testable build will
            happen in the maintenance incident project. Also the maintenance team need to write the update information on their own.</p><pre class="screen"><span class="command"><strong>osc maintenancerequest [ SOURCEPROJECT [ SOURCEPACKAGES RELEASEPROJECT ] ]</strong></span></pre><p>The following example is submitting two packages (kdelibs4 and kdebase4) from the project KDE:Devel project as 
            update for openSUSE:12.1
            </p><pre class="screen"><span class="command"><strong>osc maintenancerequest KDE:Devel kdelibs4 kdebase4 openSUSE:12.1</strong></span></pre><p>NOTE: it is also possible to specify an existing incident as target via the --incident parameter. The packages
            will be merged into that existing incident project then.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="idm140107797863872"></a>11.2.3. Way C: Process gets initiated by the maintenance team<span class="permalink"><a title="Copy Permalink" href="#idm140107797863872">¶</a></span></h3></div></div></div><p>The maintenance team may start the process (for example because a security issue was reported and the
            maintenance team decided that a fix is required). In this case the incident gets created via the webui or via
            the api call</p><p><span class="command"><strong>osc createincident [PROJECT]</strong></span></p><p><span class="command"><strong>osc api /source/PROJECT?cmd=createmaintenanceincident</strong></span></p><p><span class="command"><strong>osc api /source?cmd=createmaintenanceincident&amp;attribute=OBS:Maintenance</strong></span>.</p><p>To document the expected work the creation of a patchinfo package is needed. This can be done via</p><p><span class="command"><strong>osc patchinfo [PROJECT]</strong></span></p><p>It is important to add bugzilla entries inside of the _patchinfo file. As long these are open bugzilla entries,
            the bug assignee will see this patchinfoi on his "my work" webui and osc views, so he knows that work is expected for him.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="idm140107797857072"></a>11.2.4. Maintenance Incident Processing<span class="permalink"><a title="Copy Permalink" href="#idm140107797857072">¶</a></span></h3></div></div></div><p>The maintenance incidents are usually managed by a maintenance team. In case the incident got started by a 
	    maintainer a maintenance request is targeted towards the defined maintenance project, in our example this
	    is openSUSE:Maintenance. 
            The defined maintainer and reviewers in this project need to decide about this request. In case it gets
            accepted, the server is creating a subproject with a unique incident ID and copies the sources and build settings to it.
	    The origin project will get removed usually via the cleanup option. This maintenance project is used to build the
	    final packages. </p><p>If the maintenance team decides to merge a new maintenance request with an existing incident, they can run the
            <span class="command"><strong>osc rq setincident $REQUESTID $INCIDENT</strong></span> before accepting the request.
            </p><p>The maintenance team may still modify them or the patchinfo data at this point. An outside maintainer can still submit
	    changes via standard submit request mechanism, but direct write permissions are not granted.
	    When the maintenance people are satisfied
            with the update, they can create a request to release the sources and binaries to the final openSUSE:11.4:Update
            project.</p><pre class="screen"><span class="command"><strong>osc releaserequest</strong></span></pre><p>The release request needs to specify the source and target for each package. In case just the source package or 
            project is specified the api is completing the request on creation time. It is using this based on the source link
            target of each package and the release information in the repository definitions.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="idm140107795778128"></a>11.2.5. Incident gets released<span class="permalink"><a title="Copy Permalink" href="#idm140107795778128">¶</a></span></h3></div></div></div><p>The release process gets usually started via creating a release request. This sets all affected packages to the
            locked state, which means that all commands for editing the source or triggering rebuilds are not allowed anymore.
            </p><p>The release request typically needs to be approved by QA and other teams as defined in the Update project. In case 
            something gets declined, the necessary changes need to be submitted to the maintenance project and a new release request
            has to be created.</p><p>A unique release ID will be generated and become part of the updateinfo.xml file in the target project on release event.
            This ID is different from the incident ID and is usually in the style of "YEAR-COUNTER". The counter is strictly increasing
            on each release. In case of a re-release of the same incident a release counter will be added.</p><p> A different naming scheme
            can be defined via the OBS:MaintenanceIdTemplate attribute value. The release will move all packages to the update
            project and extend the target package name with the incident ID. Binaries will be moved as well without modification.
            The exception is the updateinfo.xml which will be modified by replacing its incident id with the release id.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="idm140107795773888"></a>11.2.6. Incident gets reopened and re-released<span class="permalink"><a title="Copy Permalink" href="#idm140107795773888">¶</a></span></h3></div></div></div><p>An update should not, but may have an undetected regression. In this case the update needs a re-release. (If another problem
            shall be fixed a new incident should be created instead.)</p><p>If the current update harms the systems, the maintenance team may decide to take it back immediatly. It can be done by removing the
            patchinfo.ID package container in the Update projects. This will create a new update channel without this update.</p><p>To re-open a release incident project, it must get unlocked and marked as open again.
            Unlocking can be done either via revoking a release request or via explicit unlocking the incident. The explicit
            unlock via osc:
      </p><pre class="screen"><span class="command"><strong>osc unlock INCIDENT_PROJECT</strong></span></pre><p>
            is also triggering a rebuild to ensure to have higher release numbers and adding the "trigger=maintenance" flags to the
            release target definitions.
            Afterwards the project can be edited again and also gets listed as running incident again.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="idm140107795769264"></a>11.2.7. Using custom update IDs<span class="permalink"><a title="Copy Permalink" href="#idm140107795769264">¶</a></span></h3></div></div></div><p>The used string of update IDs can be defined via the OBS:MaintenanceIdTemplate attribute value of the master
