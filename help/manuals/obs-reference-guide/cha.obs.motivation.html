    The basic challenge when distributing Free and Open Source Software (<acronym class="acronym">FOSS</acronym>) is compiling all
    of the source code that the awesome community produces into machine code. It may sound simple, but it isn’t. A typical
    GNU/Linux distribution consists of thousands of individual software projects. They build on top of each other,
    have functional dependencies, some of the projects are interdependent, conflict with each other and what not.
    In short, it's like herding cats. Another challenge distributing software is that, sadly, software is sometimes
    defective and people, even developers, make mistakes. One has to master the art of exchanging pieces without breaking
    the whole: in other words, software updates. The Open Build Service (<acronym class="acronym">OBS</acronym>) is a tool that makes this possible.
    It is a generic system to build and distribute binary packages from sources in an <span class="emphasis"><em>automatic</em></span>,
    <span class="emphasis"><em>consistent</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>reproducible</em></span> way. The OBS is free software itself, you can run,
    copy, distribute, study, change and improve it. The source code and the developers are on
    <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service" target="_top">github</a>.

      The goals of the OBS orientate towards the three groups of people that use it: People who contribute to the Free Software
      community by building binary packages of software, so called <span class="emphasis"><em>packagers</em></span>. <span class="emphasis"><em>Free Software
      projects and Independent Software Vendors (<acronym class="acronym">ISV</acronym>)</em></span> who provide complete software stacks
      and distributions to their users. And, of course, <span class="emphasis"><em>users</em></span> who are looking to install software
      on their GNU/Linux distribution.

	For people who contribute to the Free Software community by packaging software, so called packagers,
	the OBS tries to automate that task as much as possible. Especially the need to maintain a lot of different
	operating system (<acronym class="acronym">OS</acronym>) installations, of different <acronym class="acronym">OS</acronym> versions, on a
	lot of different hardware architectures is something the OBS makes easier.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="idp1394985756"></a>1.1.2. Reproducibility for Free Software projects and Independent Software Vendors (<acronym class="acronym">ISV</acronym>)<span class="permalink"><a title="Copy Permalink" href="#idp1394985756">¶</a></span></h3></div></div></div><p>
        The OBS emphasizes to make builds reproducible. It builds packages in a jailed environment that the OBS sets up
	from scratch each time and once the build succeeds it also rebuilds all the dependent software. This ensures that
	changes propagate throughout the entire stack and that users get a consistent product to install. Reproducibility
	is especially needed if the delivered software stack consists of a lot of parts that have functional dependencies.
	Because if something is reproducible, it is predictable, and that is what projects and ISVs aims for. If you can
	predict how each of the software packages within you GNU/Linux distribution influences each other, you can make sure
	that if you change one of them, the whole thing still works as expected.
        The OBS also has collaboration among developer baked in and will help projects and ISVs to harness the power of the
	open source development model.

	The OBS aims to make it easy for users to download the latest version of software as binary packages for their
        operating system. They don't have to know about tarballs, make install, package formats or other stuff from the 90's.
	Another priority is to make use of the package management tools of the users OS with which they are already familiar.
	Users should get their software from the OBS just as they get software from their OS supplier, no special tools needed.
	And once users are connected to a repository, they get served with maintenance or security updates or even add-ons for
	their software.

	With the advent of test driven development and similar agile methods in recent years, the software development community
	has shown a clear trend towards automated and continuous
	<a class="ulink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_Integration" target="_top">integration</a>,
	<a class="ulink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_deployment" target="_top">deployment</a> and
	<a class="ulink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery" target="_top">delivery</a>. The OBS is moving more and more from a standalone
	solution to be one link in the chain of software development tools. And while "software is eating the world", it is also
	becomming more complex every day. This prompts for the need to know who has, when, changed what. And when and
	how was that delivered to the users? Tracking and analyzing this, making trends visible to be able to act upon them is
	another challenge for the future. All of this besides the general challenge of keeping up with the fast and disruptive
	evolution of the Free Software ecosystem, which constantly supports new hardware, software, standards and tools makes up for
	a very interesting future.
